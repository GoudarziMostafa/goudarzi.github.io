                    <ul>
                        <li>Status: Under Review in Journal of Operations Management</li>
                        <li>Summary: In this paper, we enhance the traditional Real Options Game (ROG) framework by integrating fairness concerns. We investigate decision-making in a leader-follower Stackelberg game, where leaders face the choice of imposing risky outcomes on followers or delegating decisions. Using laboratory experiments, we show that increased uncertainty prompts leaders to delegate decisions to achieve fairer outcomes, and second movers tend to choose equitable options. These findings strongly support our theoretical model's predictions and demonstrate the impact of other-regarding preferences in ROG.</li>

                <li><strong>Choice Under the Radar: Experimental Insights into the Shadow Economy and Tax Evasion</strong>, Co-authored with: Luigi Mittone
                    <ul>
                        <li>Status: Under Review in Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</li>
                        <li>Summary: In this study, we simulate a credit market in a laboratory setting to investigate how the presence of a shadow economy influences tax behavior under a variety of treatments. Our innovative approach includes analyzing both the demand and supply sides, utilizing semantic prosody, and employing a framework free from direct references to taxes. We show that the presence of a shadow economy significantly impacts decision-making. While it attracts tax evaders, a notable number of participants chose to avoid the shadow economy but still evaded taxes within the formal economy. Conversely, those in the untaxed economy often paid fees similar to taxes to hedge against detection risks. In addition, the use of semantic prosody increased tax compliance across the board, highlighting its broad applicability.</li>

                        <li>Status: Preliminary Research Phase</li>
                        <li>Summary: In this research, I explore trader behavior in a sequential trading experiment with fuzzy private information. I aim to map trader heuristics into a rule-based expert system using ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System) and examine the impact of an algo-trader on herd behavior in the experimental asset market, employing a complex systems approach.</li>
